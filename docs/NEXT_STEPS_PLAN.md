  async getGeneratedCode(sessionId: string): Promise<CodeResponse>
  async getVisualization(sessionId: string): Promise<ChartResponse>
  async getModelResults(sessionId: string): Promise<ModelResponse>
}

// Workflow state management with Zustand
interface WorkflowStore {
  currentStep: AgentType | null
